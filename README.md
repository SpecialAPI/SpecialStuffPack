# In-Game Bug Reporting
If you noticed a bug caused by this mod or have some feedback, you can now send it to me through the in-game bug reporting/feedback system. The best way to do that is through the new F8 menu. There you can enter the name, description and priority of your bug report/feedback, as well as specify if it's a bug report or feedback. You can also do that through the console, using the commands starting with `spapi feedback`. Actually using the command `spapi feedback` will show help on how to use the commands. **NOTE: Bug reports should only be about bugs you are ABSOLYTELY SURE are caused by this mod. Feedback can be any non-bug related feedback about the mod, including balancing, quality of life suggestions for the mod's content, etc.**
