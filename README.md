| Wooden Token | Active | ![D](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/enterthegungeon_gamepedia/images/6/60/D_Quality_Item.png/revision/latest?cb=20160421180829 "D") | Can't be used. Entering a new floor while holding it will create the Resourceful Rat shortcut shop, even if the player didn't use a shortcut elevator. Getting an item from the rat will remove the wooden token from the player. Because the items in the shortcut shop get better with each floor, it can be worth it to keep the token until Forge. The shortcut shops can't be created in Bullet Hell. If obtained in the Forge or Bullet Hell, the token can be used, giving the player 115 casings and a random D tier gun on use. If the player exits the Forge or Bullet Hell when the token can be used (by using Clone for example), the token will no longer be useable. | Defeat the Dragun after taking a shortcut to the Forge |

<summary>Singleplayer Cultist:
</summary>
While SpecialAPI's Stuff is active, the Cultist in the Breach will be active even without a controller connected. When talked to without a controller, you will be able to switch to the Cultist like any normal character. The singleplayer Cultist shares the appearance with normal cultist, but can talk to NPCs like normal. While in singleplayer, the Friendship Cookie will instead heal 1 heart and the Number 2 will only grant it's bonuses while the player has no companions or orbitals (including Glass Guon Stones). The singleplayer Cultist currently has no unlocks except the singleplayer Number 2 unlock by defeating the High Dragun with the singleplayer Cultist. These changes will also be applied to cultist from the `character` command in the console.
