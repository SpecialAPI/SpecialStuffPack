|Name|Type|Quality|Effect|Unlock|
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Wooden Token | Active | ![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecialAPI/EnterTheGungeonTierImageStorage/main/D.png "D") | Can't be used. Entering a new floor while holding it will create the Resourceful Rat shortcut shop, even if the player didn't use a shortcut elevator. Getting an item from the rat will remove the wooden token from the player. Because the items in the shortcut shop get better with each floor, it can be worth it to keep the token until Forge. The shortcut shops can't be created in Bullet Hell. If obtained in the Forge or Bullet Hell, the token can be used, giving the player 115 casings and a random D tier gun on use. If the player exits the Forge or Bullet Hell when the token can be used (by using Clone for example), the token will no longer be useable. | Defeat the Dragun after taking a shortcut to the Forge |
| PAY 2 WIN | Active | ![B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecialAPI/EnterTheGungeonTierImageStorage/main/B.png "B") | Can only be used near chest. When used, upgrades the nearest chest for casings. Better chests cost more to upgrade. Brown chests cost 25 casings, blue chests cost 35, green chests cost 50, red chests cost 85 and black chests cost 215. | |
| Fused Ammolet | Passive | ![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecialAPI/EnterTheGungeonTierImageStorage/main/D.png "D") | Using blanks now creates a blank bomb instead. Blank bombs explode after 1 second. When a blank bomb explodes, it will create an explosion dealing 250 damage in a 3 tile radius and also cause a normal blank effect. The explosions can't hurt the player. | |
| Special API's Stuff | Active | ![B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecialAPI/EnterTheGungeonTierImageStorage/main/B.png "B") | 250 damage cooldown.

| Convict's Shackles | Active (Unlocked)/Passive (Locked) | ![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecialAPI/EnterTheGungeonTierImageStorage/main/C.png "C") | On use, the item is "locked", consuming the active item and granting a passive item that can't be dropped, removes 1 heart container, caps the player's max health at the current amount and gives a +4.5 flat damage up (the damage up scales with the gun's chance multiplier, meaning it's way weaker for guns that fire quicker and way stronger for guns that fire faster). Going to a new floor makes the item "rusted", which makes it remove an additional half heart container and only give a +1 flat damage up when locked. | |
| Resourceful Whistle | Active | ![A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecialAPI/EnterTheGungeonTierImageStorage/main/A.png "A") | 275 damage cooldown. Can't be stolen by the Resourceful Rat. On use, summons the Resourceful Rat to steal guns from enemies and bomb them afterwards. The rat can only steal from one enemy at a time. The bombs from the Rat can recharge the item, meaning that the item will be partially recharged when the rat leaves. The Rat can't steal guns from bosses. After picking up the item once, the rat will no longer be able to steal items from the player, unless the player has the Ring of the Resourceful Rat |  |
| Subscribe Button | Passive | ![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpecialAPI/EnterTheGungeonTierImageStorage/main/S.png "S") | Gives the player a 5% damage up for each subscriber the player has. Subscribers can be gained in different ways, for example by picking up certain items like some bullet upgrades. The player also gains subscribers when fighting some bosses like the Wallmonger. | |

Bosses affected by this effect will only take 50% more damage. | |

<summary>Singleplayer Cultist:
</summary>
While SpecialAPI's Stuff is active, the Cultist in the Breach will be active even without a controller connected. When talked to without a controller, you will be able to switch to the Cultist like any normal character. The singleplayer Cultist shares the appearance with normal cultist, but can talk to NPCs like normal. While in singleplayer, the Friendship Cookie will instead heal 1 heart and the Number 2 will only grant it's bonuses while the player has no companions or orbitals (including Glass Guon Stones). The singleplayer Cultist currently has no unlocks except the singleplayer Number 2 unlock by defeating the High Dragun with the singleplayer Cultist. These changes will also be applied to cultist from the `character` command in the console.
